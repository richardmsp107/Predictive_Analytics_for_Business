# Predictive Analytics for Business

### Minseok (Richard) Park

This repository contains projects for [Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd008t) from Udacity 

### Part 1: Program Overview
Learn to apply a framework to work through problems and build a linear regression and build a linear regression model to provide results and a recommendation. 

•	Project: [Predicting Diamond Prices](https://github.com/richardmsp107/Predictive_Analytics_for_Business/blob/master/Program%20Overview/Predicting%20Diamond%20Prices.pdf)

### Part 2: [Problem Solving with Analytics](https://www.udacity.com/course/problem-solving-with-advanced-analytics--ud976)
Select the most appropriate analytical methodology based on the context of the business problem. Build, validate, and apply linear regression models to solve a business problem.

•	Project: [Predicting Catalog Demand](https://github.com/richardmsp107/Predictive_Analytics_for_Business/blob/master/Problem%20Solving%20with%20Analytics/Catalog%20Demand%20Project.pdf)

### Part 3: Data Wrangling
Understand the most common data types and various sources of data. Identify common types of dirty data, make adjustments to dirty data to prepare a dataset. Identify and adjust for outliers. Summarize, cross-tabulate, transpose, and reformat data to prepare a dataset for analysis.

•	Project: [Create an Analytical Dataset](https://github.com/richardmsp107/Predictive_Analytics_for_Business/blob/master/Data%20Wrangling/Create%20an%20Analytical%20Dataset.pdf)

### Part 4: [Classification Models](https://www.udacity.com/course/classification-models--ud978)
Build logistics regression and decision tree models. Use stepwise to automate predictor variable selection. Build and compare forest and boosted model. Score and compare models and interpret the results. 

•	Project: [Predicting Default Risk](https://github.com/richardmsp107/Predictive_Analytics_for_Business/blob/master/Classification%20Models/Predicting%20Default%20Risk.pdf)

### Part 5: [A/B Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud979)
Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including selecting target and control units and variables and the duration of a test. Design a randomized design A/B test, matched pair design A/B test, use trend and seasonality as control variables for matched pari design A/B test and analyze the results.

•	Project: [A/B Test a New Menu Launch](https://github.com/richardmsp107/Predictive_Analytics_for_Business/blob/master/AB%20Testing/AB%20Testing%20A%20New%20Menu%20Launch.pdf)

### Part 6: [Time Series Forecasting](https://www.udacity.com/course/time-series-forecasting--ud980)
Understand trend, seasonal, and cyclical patterns of time series data. Use time series decomposition plots. Build ETS and ARIMA models and interpret the various results from time series model.

### Part 7: [Segmentation and Clustering](https://www.udacity.com/course/segmentation-and-clustering--ud981)
Understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model. Then complete a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.
